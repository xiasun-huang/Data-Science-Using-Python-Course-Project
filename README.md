# Data-Science-Using-Python-Course-Project
This project is inspired by Altman's Z score model which is one of the most popular financial model used to prodict bankruptcy. The dataset was collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal. Dataset contains 96 columns and 6819 rows with the details of company bankruptcy based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The data includes a majority of numerical attributes that help understand the possibility of bankruptcy. In the light of Altman's Z score model, the categories of the key variables were diversified into: profitability, liquidity, leverage, and efficiency. Throughout this project, I was responsible for writing all python scripts.
